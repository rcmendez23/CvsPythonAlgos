# CvsPythonAlgos
Comparing C vs. Python on classic algorithms for a recommendation report in ENGW 3302

# Criteria
Each program operates on file data[size].txt, reporting back execution time, in seconds, for the entire program.

All sorting code was sourced from geeksforgeeks.org.

# Instructions
Python: modify _filename_ in each .py file to test the proper data size.

C: modify __NUMEL__ and _filename_ in each .c file to test the proper data size.

data1000.txt = 1,000 elements

data10000.txt = 10,000 elements

data100000.txt = 100,000 elements

data1000000.txt = 1,000,000 elements


Most Python scripts are only compatible with Python3.

# C Compilation and Execution (from shell)
